1) Copy .lat, .long, .elev, and .time properties (henceforth called 'shot properties') to 'trimmed' shot properties
2) Impose bounds upon the data based on study region limitations; anything that doesn't fall within them is made NaN. These limitations are currently eyeballed (thus really generous) and might be tweaked, but right now the requirements are 52>lat>60 (deg), 100>long>150 (deg) , 1000>elev>4000 (m), 7.35e5>time>7.39e (sec?).
3) That gets rid of most of the bizarre and obviously erroneous values, but there are still some clearly wrong measurements. I run a 7-wide Gaussian convolution over the data to smooth it out. Anything that lies more than a standard deviation from the Gaussian convolution is made NaN. This process is visualized when you process each bedPicks .mat file.
4) I get the shot properties for each pick (even if it occurs somewhat between shots) by linearly interpolating the value of the two shots the pick is between.
5) All processed files are loaded into one large data structure. Any shots for which any of the shot properties are NaN are moved.
