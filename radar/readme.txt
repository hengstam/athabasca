readme for radar folder
03 june 2019

waveforms = raw waveform files for each cross-glacier radar profile.
This folder contains many subfolders like mar<x>_<y> where x is the date and y is the profile number on that date. These numbers agree with those shown in /figures/surveys_latLon_withSurveyLabels.pdf
Inside each subfolder you will see many text files containing raw waveforms named things like wv<xx> where xx is the shot number for that profile.

mat_files = folder containing .mat files produced by running readwv.m on a folder in waveforms.
