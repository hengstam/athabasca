mar4_1:
	Did not digitize. >20 shots and impossible to read.

mar4_2:
	Static until #17 and after #66. Potiential large bowtie centered at #30. Large feature at #60/130m potientially a point source hyperbola but slope seems too steep. Difficult to determine bedrock after #40. Bedrock might be below the large hyperbolic feature but unsure. Did not digitize past #40.

mar4_3:
	Static until #12 and after #105. Generally strong bedrock reflector, weakens between #22-28, #33-40 (skipped, too weak), and #58-61.

mar4_4:
	Static until #16 and after #93. Weak bedrock reflector, weakens further between #42-#49 and is impossible to follow between #69-75 and #80-87. Interesting artifact centered at #75/310m. 

mar4_5:
	Static until #25 and after #162. Generally strong if confusing bedrock reflector, weakens between #93 and #110 and patchy after #130. Potiential bowtie centered at #90. Strange continued reflectors apparent at #100 (two of them, from opposite directions) and at #45. Followed the highest probably bedrock reflector in digitization. Could not discern bedrock reflector from #147-157. Small "downward" slope centered at #155/200m seems too much like an echo from a near-surface reflector of the same shape for me to trust it. 

mar4_6:
	Because of the short length of this transect it was difficult to interpret from the little context present. Nevertheless, I think I can pretty confidentally say the reflector at about 230m is bedrock. Static until #17.

mar4_7:
	Static until #36, "burned out" after #69. Patchy bedrock reflector. Might also be static from #38-40 but I decided to mark each shot in that range. More doubled up/continued reflectors from #44-60 combined with the weak reflector made me unable to confidently mark the bedrock reflector. Very strong repeated reflectors from this poor area (#44-60) in the 30-150m range.

mar5_1:
	Static and burned out until ~#85. Static from ~#155-170. 4(?)-shot artifact at ~#140. Generally strong reflector--really stands out more than the mar4-series transects. While difficult to tell because of the static area, possible bowtie centered at #145/215m. This and other reflectors not digitized at every shot because of the long transect size--the high resolution made it not feasable to control the mouse that finely. 

mar5_2:
	Static before ~#40 and after ~#260. Very confusing reflector--I'm not going to attempt to digitize this without talking to Dr. Marshall first. Certain bowtie centered at #108/270m. 

mar5_3: 
	Static before #45, between #72-78 and after #270. Possible artifacts at ~#172 and ~#180. Beautiful bedrock reflector. 

mar5_4:
	Static before #42 and after #290. Potiential bowtie at #70 and small but strong bowtie at #145. Generally excellent bedrock reflector, although from #55-#65 it is confusing enough that I didn't feel confident enough to delineate it. 

mar5_5:
	Strange transect. Static before ~#40 and after ~#255. Returns after #110 show a substantial and consistent drop in amplitude, which coincides with a patchier bedrock reflector, completely disapperaring in some locations (#110-125, #130-145, #155-170, possibly after #240). Base reflector after #240 has a suspiciously hyperbolic shape, leading me to suspect that they are a result of a point reflector at #240/140m rather than the bedrock reflector. Many portions not delineated due to these concerns. Possible bowtie at #100. Gap at #110-125 coincides with strong near-suface reflector cenetered at #118/100m.

mar5_6:
	Static before ~#25, between ~#90-115 and after ~#310. Gap in bedrock reflector from #120-#135. Very strong reflector at ~#230/25m with multiple very strong reflections. Strange jump in amplitude and bedrelock reflector depth at #158. Possible bowtie at #165. 

mar5_7:
	Static before #60 and after #280. Decrease in return amplitude after shot #240. Artifacts at shots #108, #160, and #195-199.

mar5_8:
	Static before #65, between #115-135, and after #290. Excellent reflector, possibly the best I've seen yet. Small anomaly at #255.

mar6_1:
	Static before #120 and after #330. Large classic bowtie centered at #235/275m. Hyperbola at #295/100m seems like it's probably a point reflector, but unsure. Decided to call the weaker but broader reflector below it the bedrock. 

mar6_2: 
	Static before #45 and after #260. Not the strongest always but a very clean reflector. Large bowtie at #275/120m.

mar6_3:
	Static before #65 and after #225. Otherwise excellent.

mar6_4: 
	Static before #40 and after #240. A bit weak from #60-80, otherwise excellent. 

mar6_5: 
	Static before #70, from #245-260, and after #280. Strange artifacts at shot #125 and near shots #140-150. Clear change in gain around shot #185. Difficult interpretation of the bedrock reflector near the change in gain. Did not attempt to digitize in this region.

mar6_6:
	Static before #30 and after #225. Nice reflector although a lot of gain anomalies. Beautiful bowtie at #125/275m, potiential subglacial channel? Slightly strange reflector shape near #175. Noise patterns in this region do not seem to be static, but the reflector shape suggests it.

mar6_7:
	Static before #52 and after #235. Beautiful reflector.

mar6_8:
	Static before #45 and after #245. Nice reflector.

mar6_9:
	Static before #71. Crappy transect.

mar6_10:
	Uninterpretable. Did not digitize.

mar6_11:
	Static before #50. Generally good transect but some bizarre anomalies apparently only recieving air waves at #148, #154, #174, and after #187.

mar6_12:
	This is an interesting one. Static ebfore #115 and after #285. Big bowties at #165/210m and #215/230m. Doubled relector after #260, I chose the upper arrival.

mar6_13:
	Static before #60, from #175-185, and after #240. A few interesting near-feature features after #200. Chose the most continous reflector, which seems to be the bottom one in this case.

mar6_14:
	Static before #36 and after #218. Big bowtie at #115/210m. Big weird anomaly at #185. I'm a bit unsure about the reflector neat #80. I went with the uppermost reflector.

mar6_15:
	Static before #45, between #115-135, and after #185.

mar7_1:
	Static before #35 and after #52.

mar7_2:
	Static before #37 and after #186. Big bowties at #120/175m and possibly at #135/155m.

mar7_3:
	Static before #45, from #150-158, from #168-176, and after #184. Strong, complex reflector with lots of bowties (or possibly point reflectors) clustered around #80/150m.

mar7_4:
	Static before #30 and after #147. Again, multiple point reflectors clustered around #50/150m.

mar7_5:
	Static before #48 and after #125. Big near-surface anomaly at #83. Possibly a very strong in-air reflector? Multiples seem to be the same time apart from one another as the air signal.

mar7_6:
	Static before #35 and after #170. Clean reflector, massive bowtie at #92/125m.

mar7_7:
	Static before #35 and after #120. Nice reflector.

mar7_8:
	Static before #37 and after #142. Really really good reflector.

mar7_9:
	Static before #44 and after #110. Really really good reflector.

mar7_10:
	Static before #40, around #225, around #325, and terminates after #530. A lot of features here, particularly the bowtie at #300/125m and the big anomaly around #125.
